## Changes

Now that you have spawned a levelcheck NPC, you can change a couple of settings. If you want to change something about the levelcheck NPC, you'll have to select him first. You can do this by typing ``/npc select``. 
After you've selected your NPC you can do a couple of different things:
- You can change the skin by using /npc skin <playername>.
- You can force the NPC to look at the nearest player with /npc lookclose.
